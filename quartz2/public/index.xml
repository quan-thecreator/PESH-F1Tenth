    <description>text SLAM by Durrant 2006 Part 1 § Notes on the Abstract § There appear to be several reasons why this paper is a especial industry favorite as it clearly opens with the following hooks: targets small, mobile, embedded and low power systems of the time and discusses implementation in a tutorial format Discourse § Introduction § Starting with a definition, the Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) problem/problem scenario (more on this later) requires and the checks the possibility of a “mobile robot” incrementally building a map of its vicinity while also determining its location in the course, when placed into an unknown and un-cached environment.</description>
