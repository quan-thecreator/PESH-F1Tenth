# Meetings
## Meeting #1
Action items:

- Github (naturally)
- The competition itself (show them the website, and there should be a slack that they can join for like competition/rules questions)
    - https://join.slack.com/t/f1tenthxkorea/shared_invite/zt-1ibqf5yjq-CkG_z1XRhsZgBsCoSy7JiA (Slack join code)
  - https://korea-race23.f1tenth.org// (Previous race)
-  Discuss club stuff
    - Vote on whether to be a school club or just a private team (If we get school stuff we basically can advertise at school and have in school meetings, but there's a shit ton a bureaucracy involved, especially with *international* travel and funds)
   - Discuss how to split the costs (3k for the car and more for travel, spare parts, etc.), and how much each person will be willing to pay up front
   - Officer positions (You can make these up at your discretion, or you can leave them out)This stuff should cover the 2 hours imo
