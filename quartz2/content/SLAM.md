Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a field of robotics and computer vision that deals with the problem of a robot or a device navigating an environment while simultaneously building a map of that environment. Here are some foundational papers on SLAM:

1. **"Simultaneous Localization and Map Building" by Hugh F. Durrant-Whyte and Tim Bailey (2006)**:
   - This paper provides an overview of the SLAM problem and introduces the basic concepts. It discusses both probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches to SLAM.

2. **"A Solution to the Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM) Problem" by Michael Montemerlo, et al. (2002)**:
   - This paper presents a practical solution to the SLAM problem using Rao-Blackwellized particle filters. It discusses the application of this approach to real-world robotic systems.

3. **"FastSLAM: A Scalable Method for the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Problem in Robotics" by Michael Montemerlo, et al. (2003)**:
   - This paper introduces FastSLAM, an efficient variant of the SLAM algorithm based on particle filters. It addresses the computational challenges associated with traditional SLAM methods.

4. **"Visual SLAM: Why filter?" by J. M. M. Montiel, J. Civera, and A. J. Davison (2006)**:
   - This paper focuses on visual SLAM and discusses the advantages of using a nonlinear optimization approach instead of the more traditional extended Kalman filter.

5. **"MonoSLAM: Real-Time Single Camera SLAM" by Andrew J. Davison (2007)**:
   - This paper presents MonoSLAM, a real-time SLAM system that uses a single camera. It employs an extended Kalman filter for estimation and demonstrates the feasibility of real-time monocular SLAM.

6. **"ORB-SLAM: a Versatile and Accurate Monocular SLAM System" by Raul Mur-Artal, J. M. M. Montiel, and Juan D. Tardos (2015)**:
   - This paper introduces ORB-SLAM, a feature-based monocular SLAM system that uses a bag of binary features for real-time operation.

7. **"LSD-SLAM: Large-Scale Direct Monocular SLAM" by Jakob Engel, et al. (2014)**:
   - This paper presents LSD-SLAM, a method that directly operates on image intensities for monocular SLAM. It achieves accurate and robust performance across a wide range of environments.

These papers should provide a solid foundation for understanding the principles and advancements in SLAM. Keep in mind that the field evolves, so it's always good to explore more recent literature for the latest developments.

In this note, we will link to several exploratory notes into the papers above.
